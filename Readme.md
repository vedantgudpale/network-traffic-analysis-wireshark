# Packet Capture & Analysis with Wireshark

## Summary
This project shows how to use Wireshark to record and examine real-time network traffic.  
An active network interface was used for the capture in order to identify and examine various network protocols.

## Tools Used: **Wireshark** for protocol analysis and packet capture.

## Actions Taken
1. On the active network interface, a live capture was initiated.
2. Created traffic by pinging servers and perusing websites.
3. To examine particular traffic, protocol filters (DNS, TCP, HTTPS) were applied.
4. For additional analysis, the packet capture file was saved in the `.pcap` format.

## Protocols Found
Domain names are resolved to IP addresses via **DNS**.  
A dependable, connection-oriented transport protocol is **TCP**.  
The secure web communication protocol is known as **HTTPS**.

## Files in this Repository: `capture.pcap`, which is the packet capture that was saved.
